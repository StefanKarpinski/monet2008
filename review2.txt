Reviewer #2: In this paper, the authors propose a network traffic model, called the General Matrix Model (GMM). The key idea of GMM is to represent each flow of a traffic collection with components representing various characteristics of the flow, such as the IP protocol type, source node, destination node, start time, flow size, packet sizes, and inter-packet intervals. Simulation results show that, GMM is able to reproduce the trace data more accurately than several simplistic traffic models such as uniform models, marginal models, and regular models.

I understand the contribution of the paper as follows. Since GMM is a better model, when evaluating any networking protocols, it would be more convincing if the performance evaluation results are obtained by simulation runs that use GMM to generate the network traffic. However, since GMM is a more complicated model, I would assume that it is computationally more complicated to generate GMM-based traffic. There is no discussion on this issue in the paper. Moreover, I am not so sure about the technical depth of this paper. The idea of GMM sounds straightforward/trivial. By considering more flow characteristics than other simple models, of course GMM would outperform them; no surprise. So the technical merit of the paper is not clear.

A few typos and errors in the paper. For example: - page 3, right col, 2nd para, 4th line from bottom: "six matrices" should be "seven matrices" - page 5, right col, 1st para, 3rd line from top: "do" should be "to" - page 5, right col, 1st para, 6th line from top: "the" should be "they" and more. Authors should give a thorough check on typos and errors for the entire paper.
