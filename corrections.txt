Original: The direction of the distortion may change, but the fact that they are inaccurate does not. See previous work using the same technique for evaluating realism for further examples with different experimental conditions and sets of performance metrics considered~\cite{Karpinski07:realism,Karpinski07:cbr-failure}.
Replacement: The direction of the distortion may change, but the presence or absence of accuracy does not. See previous work using the same technique for evaluating realism for further examples with different experimental conditions and more performance metrics considered~\cite{Karpinski07:realism,Karpinski07:cbr-failure}.

Original: In this section we describe matrix factorization, which provides an approximate low-rank representation of the original traffic. This technique not only allows us to model and analyze traffic without destroying the information content, but also leads us to a deep analytical understanding of network behaviors that matches our intuitive understanding of typical modes of network behavior.

Original: where $\mat{W} \in \R^{f \times b}$ and $\mat{H} \in \R^{b \times (d_z+d_v)}$ are both row-stochastic, while $\mat{\Sigma} \in \R^{b \times b}$ is diagonal with descending diagonal entries. $b\in\N$ is the rank of this factorization, which must be determined somehow as well.
