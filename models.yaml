- Node:
  - Trace:
    - session start time assigned from trace
    - each node corresponds to a specific trace node with associated trace flows
    - overrides all distributions with node-specific versions
  - Nonparametric:
    - session start time randomly assigned from pool of trace session start times
    - nodes assigned as flow end-points by sampling from inherited src/dst distributions
  - Parametric:
    - session start time assigned according to Poisson arrival model*
    - nodes assigned as flow end-points by sampling from fitted BiPareto model*
  - Uniform:
    - session start times selected uniformly from viable range
    - nodes have the mean number of generic flows

- Flow:
  - Trace:
    - flow start time and size taken from trace
    - each flow corresponds to a specific trace flow with an associated packet trace
    - overrides distributions of size/interval packet behaviors with flow-specific versions
    - packet stream from trace file
  - Nonparametric:
    - start time relative to previous flow sampled from inherited distribution
    - flow size sampled from inherited distribution of flow sizes
    - inherits distributions of size/interval packet behaviors from destination node
    - generic packets generated until flow size exhausted
  - Parametric:
    - start time relative to previous flow sampled from fitted Lognormal model*
    - flow size sampled from fitted BiPareto model*
    - inherits distributions of size/interval packet behaviors from destination node
    - generic packets generated until flow size exhausted
  - Uniform:
    - start time relative to previous flow equals mean inherited inter-flow interval
    - all flows have size equal to inherited mean flow size
    - inherits distributions of size/interval packet behaviors from destination node
    - generic packets generated until flow size exhausted

- Packet:
  - Trace:         each packet corresponds to a specific trace packet
  - Nonparametric: packet sizes and intervals sampled from inherited distributions
  - Parametric:    packet sizes and intervals drawn from fitted Exponential distributions*
  - Uniform:       all packet sizes and inter-packet intervals are equal to inherited mean
