- Node:
  - Trace:
    - each node corresponds to a specific trace node with associated trace flows
    - session start time assigned from trace
    - overrides all distributions with node-specific versions
  # - Dependent:
  #   - each node corresponds to a specific trace node
  #   - specific flows assigned to nodes by sampling
  #   - session start time assigned from trace
  #   - overrides all distributions with node-specific versions
  - Nonparametric:
    - generic flows assigned to nodes by sampling [TODO---more detail]
    - session start time randomly assigned from pool of trace session start times
  - Parametric:
    - generic flows assigned to nodes according to fitted BiPareto model*
    - session start time assigned according to Poisson arrival model*
  - Uniform:
    - all nodes have average number of generic flows
    - session start times uniformly cover viable range

- Flow:
  - Trace:
    - each flow corresponds to a specific trace flow with an associated packet trace
    - flow size and start time taken from trace
    - overrides distributions of size/interval packet behaviors with flow-specific versions
  - Nonparametric:
    - flow size is sampled from inherited distribution of flow sizes
    - start time relative to previous session flow sampled from inherited distribution
    - inherits distributions of size/interval packet behaviors from destination node
  - Parametric:
    - flow size is sampled from fitted BiPareto model*
    - start time relative to previous flow in session sampled from fitted Lognormal model*
    - inherits distributions of size/interval packet behaviors from destination node
  - Uniform:
    - all flows have size equal to inherited mean
    - average inter-flow interval used between all flows
    - inherits distributions of size/interval packet behaviors from destination node

- Packet:
  - Trace:         each packet corresponds to a specific trace packet
  - Nonparametric: packet sizes and intervals sampled from inherited distributions
  - Parametric:    packet sizes and intervals drawn from fitted Exponential distributions*
  - Uniform:       all packet sizes and inter-packet intervals are equal to inherited mean
