- Packet:
  - Individual: each packet corresponds to a specific trace packet
  - Sampled:    packet sizes and intervals are sample from inherited distributions
  - Parametric: packet sizes and intervals are drawn from inherited parametric distributions
  - Uniform:    all packet sizes and inter-packet intervals are equal to inherited mean

- Flow:
  - Individual:
    - each flow corresponds to a specific trace flow with an associated packet trace
    - overrides distribution of time-size packet behavior
  - Sampled:
    - flow size is sampled from inherited distribution of flow sizes
  - Parametric:
    - flow size is samples BiPareto distribution with inherited parameters
  - Uniform:
    - all flows have size equal to inherited mean

- Node:
  - Individual:
    - each node corresponds to a specific trace node with associated trace flows
    - session start time assigned from trace
    - overrides all distributions
  - Sampled:
    - generic flows assigned to nodes by sampling
    - session start time assigned from pool of start times
  - Parametric:
    - generic flows assigned to nodes according to BiPareto model
    - session start time randomly chosen from viable range
  - Uniform:
    - all nodes have average number of generic flows
    - session start times uniformly cover viable range
