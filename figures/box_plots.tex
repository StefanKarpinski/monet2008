\caption{%
Box-and-whisker plots of log-ratio error values for all metrics and traffic models.
The lower axis indicates the log-ratio, while the upper axis shows raw ratio values.
Each box contains the central majority of log-ratio values:
the left and right bounds are at the $25^\text{th}$ and $75^\text{th}$ percentiles.
The dark middle line indicates the median value, while the diamond marks the mean.
The whiskers (dotted lines) extend to the furthest non-outlier values, while the points beyond that are outliers. The notch in the middle of each bar indicates a $95\%$ confidence interval for the true underlying median value;
if two notches do not overlap, they are very unlikely to have the same median.
